# 05 - Programming Language Types

* **Assertive Languages**
    * Its expressions modify values of entities (data or objects)
    * **Imperative Languages**
        * Data oriented
        * **Examples**
            * C
            * Pascal
            *Fortran
    * **Object-Oriented Languages**
        * Program construction through changing states of abstracts entities called objects
        * **Examples**
            * C++
            * Smalltalk
        * **Object**
            * Set of data and operators capable of transforming those data values
* **Declarative Languages**
    * Verify or induce the ocurrence of relations between declarations
        * **Functional Languages**
            * The relations are defined by mapping symbolic structures
            * **Examples**
                * LISP
                * ML
                * Miranda
                * Haskell
        * **Logical Languages**
            * Relations are defined as expressions of mathematical logic
            * **Examples**
                * PROLOG
                * GÃ¶del
        * **Restriction-Satisfaction Oriented Languages**
            * Relations are defined as algebraic equations and inequations
            * **Examples**
                * Mozart/Oz
                * Alice
