# 04 - Desirable Characteristics For a Programming Language

* **Readability**
    * Easy to understand elements
    * Avoid ambiguity
    * **Simplicity and orthogonality**
        * Provide a small ammount of basic elements
        * Minimal set of primtives that can be combined
            * Most elaborated components should be combinations of the basic elements
    * **Control Instructions Don't Compromise Program Clarity**
        * Control instructions should be reduced to the strict set of essential flux control instructions
    * **Easy to represent types and data structures**
        * Primitive and compound types should be easy to define and manipulate
    * **Clean and brief syntax**
        * Each instruction should represent its meaning intuitively and in an unique way
* **Ease of writing**
    * Programs easy to understand come from the easiness provided by the language due to its simplicity
    * Expressiveness to solve problems in a clear and natural way
* **Reliability**
    * Solutions need to be trustable. thus implementations related to specific problems have to produce the expected outcome
    * Avoid operations with conflicting types
        * Type verification cost exceed the tricky implementation involved in it
        * Type verification guarantees trustable results
* **Cost**
    * A programming language has to be simples and trustworthy, with a low cost of development and training
