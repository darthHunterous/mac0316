# 01 - Syntax and Semantics

* A programming language has to meet the **requirements** in an **efficient** manner
    * The language has to be represented in an unique way
    * Its elements have to have unique meanings
<br><br>
* **Syntax**
    * How each language element is described
* **Semantics**
    * What means each element
* The syntax determines how to manipulate programs in a language, trying to make it an easier manipulation
* Semantics determines the intended interpretation for each syntatical element in the language, over 3 aspects
    * **Axiomatic Semantics**
        * Expression meaning is determined through synonyms
        * Described through a set of axiomatic equations
    * **Operational Semantics**
        * Meaning of each expression by what it performs
        * Described through the operations performed by the expressions
    * **Denotational Semantics**
        * Meaning of each expression can be caracterized in terms of the data transformed
        * Described by the data set associated with each expression
        * A program can be seen as a mathematical function that maps the input to each of its outputs
